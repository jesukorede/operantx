# Deployment (MVP)

## peaq testnet

- Deploy contracts using `contracts/` Hardhat scripts.
- Configure frontend/backend with `CHAIN_ID`, `PEAQ_RPC_URL`, and `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

## Notes

- MVP is designed to run locally + deploy contracts to testnet.
- Indexing/The Graph can be added post-MVP.
